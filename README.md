# pizza_hut-data-analysis
This project aims to analyze Pizza Hut's sales data to uncover insights related to customer orders, revenue, and pizza preferences. The analysis is conducted at three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, each building on the previous level to provide deeper insights into sales trends and patterns.
